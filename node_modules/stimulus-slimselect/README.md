# Stimulus SlimSelect

This is a Stimulus wrapper around the SlimSelect library.

## Install

This assumes that [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org) is already installed.

Add the `tailwindcss-stimulus-components` module:

```bash
$ yarn add stimulus-slimselect
```

or

```bash
$ npm install stimulus-slimselect
```

## Basic Usage

First, you'll want to initialize StimulusJS and then you can import all the TailwindCSS components.

```javascript
// Start StimulusJS
import { Application } from "stimulus"
import { definitionsFromContext } from "stimulus/webpack-helpers"

const application = Application.start();
const context = require.context("controllers", true, /.js$/);
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context));

// Import and register all TailwindCSS Components
import StimuluSlimSelect from "stimulus-slimselect"
application.register('slimselect', StimulusSlimSelect)
```

This will start StimulusJS and load any controllers that you have
locally and then register the Stimulus SlimSelect controller.

## Extending Components

You can use inheritance to extend the functionality of any Stimulus components.

```js
import StimulusSlimSelect from "stimulus-slimselect"

export default class MySelect extends StimulusSlimSelect{
  connect() {
    super.connect();
    console.log("hello world")
  }
}
```

These controllers will automatically have access to `targets` defined in the parent class.

If you override the `connect`, `disconnect` or any other methods from the parent, you'll want to call `super.method()` to make sure the parent functionality is executed.
